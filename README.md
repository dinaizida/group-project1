Project Description:

This app is used to find camping information and supplies. It can be easily divided into three different sections.

First the user is prompted to search for a campsite in their desired location. When the search is done the user is shown a list of camp sites and an empty weather table. A little further down is a table showing some suggestions for camping supplies. 

Next the user can click a button displayed next to a campsite's name and the weather table will fill out. It will show a five day weather forecast. The user can click on another name and the information will switch over to the new campsite's five day forecast. The user can also click on the address displayed next to the campsite and they will be take to another page displaying a google map of the location.

Finally when the user clicks for the weather the list of supplies will update and display items related to the weather they can expect to experience. The list will display different catagories that eaach have their own brands, prices, ratings, and a picture of the product. 

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, API, Materialize, Bootstrap, Affinity Photo.
